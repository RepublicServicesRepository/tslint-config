## Colors

Republic Services’ color palette is simple and strong. By effectively using a few colors, we can ensure a consistent visual language on all Republic Services materials and promotions. Proper application of these colors will be detailed in the following pages. Please use only Republic Services approved colors and formulas as specified in this guide. This palette is not to be added to or subtracted from. The colors are not to be screened, layered or otherwise changed in base or tonality, except where explicitly noted here in the brand guidelines.
