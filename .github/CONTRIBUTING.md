# Contributing

Standards and adherance to those standards are important in general, but also *extremely important* in this code base, due to the nature of how this code is shared by multiple projects within our organization.

Please take the time to read, understand, and follow all of the Standards, not limited to those mentioned in this document.

## Git Commits

Commits *must follow* our [Commit Guidelines](https://republicservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WMD/pages/33980534/Git+Workflow#GitWorkflow-Makingacommit). Please make sure all of your commits follow these guidelines, or your Pull Request (PR) might be rejected.

## GitHub Pull Requests

Pull Requests must also follow the same guidelines as Commits. See above.

All code changes must be Linted and Unit Tested. Do not bypass the automatic linting and tests. All this does is cause extra work for those reviewing your code.

## Code Reviews

All PRs must be reviewed and approved by *at least 3* core contributors in order to maintain and ensure code quality and test coverage standards are met.

For Angular code contributions, that means at least 3 *Angular developers* from the Digital Platform team must review and approve the PR before merging.

For Sass (SCSS) contributions, any 3 developers can approve your changes, but [Bob Laudner]() must also sign off and approve your PR before merging. This is in order to maintain and ensure proper adherence to the Design Standards.

>  ⚠️ Failure to observe the above requirements can result in your PR being rejected, or—worst case—your changes being reverted if they were merged but do not meet our standards.
